I am building a simple web application. I need you to help me build this out. I need step by step instructions in great detail.

I want to use the MERN stack, so use MONGODB, Express, React, and Node.

The app is called WinnerPicker.

A user will be presented with a collection of fights. The user will pick who he or she thinks is going to win the fight. The collection of fights will be called an event. A typical event has four to five fights. Each fight has two fighters. Once the user selects all the expected winners, the user can generate a shareable page or asset (defined as an image or text) by clicking a button. The purpose of the app is to share fight and event predictions.

**User workflow**
Here is how the user will use the product.

1. User comes to the site. They can either log in or not log in. If they log in, the user's picks will be saved.
2. The site presents an event, and this event includes all the fights, and the fights includes all the fighters.
3. The User will select which fighter of the fight is going to win or if they fight will be a draw. The user must choose an outcome for each fight.
4. once the user is done, they will hit generate and the app is going to produce a shareable page or asset with the user’s picks.
5. the user can share this page or asset with his or her friends. the friends can come to the website and pick their winners too.

Basic Front End information

1. The web app will consist of two pages.
2. The "Landing Page" will have two sections:
   Header section
    - just greets the user. this houses the log in ui.
      Events section
    - this has the event, the fights, the fighters. Each fighter can be clickable and will show that it has been selected.
    - there will be a submit button that takes the user's selection and produces the results page.
3. Once the submit button is selected, the user is navigated to the "Results Page". This page will have two sections.

    Normal Results

    - this will render the event, the fights, and the fighters, but there will be a check mark over the fighter who the user thinks is going to win
      Asset Results
    - this section will return the user's choices in text form

Give me the high overview on how to create this app, including back end and front end view.

Give me step by step instructions on how to build out the front end app.

the front end will only have two pages.

the first page is called the landing page. the second page is called the results page.

landing page

-   it will have two sections.
-   the first section is called the event container. this container will hold the event component.
-   the second section is called the fight container. this container will hold the fight component and a submit button that will generate the results page. there will be multiple fights so multiple fight components will be introduced. the fight component will be comprised of fighters components and the fight information.

results page

-   this page will have three sections.
-   the first section is the event container. this container will hold the event component, just like the landing page.
-   the second section will return the results. The results will render the same fight container, but it will indicate the user's picks.
-   the third section will return the results but only in text.

I have created the pages folder and components folder.

when the user is on the landing page, the event is populated automatically. how do i create this code?

This is where I left off.

Thank you for sharing your directory structure. Since you're using Vite and have already set up the basic file structure with components for events, fights, and fighters, we can proceed with manually uploading the data.

For manual data uploads in a development environment, you have a few options:

Local JSON Files: Store your event, fight, and fighter data in JSON files within your project structure. You can import these JSON files directly into your React components and use the data as initial state.

Environment Variables: If the data isn't too complex, you could use environment variables in a .env.local file. This method is not ideal for more structured or nested data like events and fighters.

Mock API: You can create a mock API using a tool like MirageJS, which lets you define models and endpoints that simulate a real API. This is a good practice for future transition to a real backend.

Global State Management: Use a context or state management library like Redux or Recoil to define a global state in your application where you can store and manage your data.

Database: If you're ready to integrate with the backend, you could set up your MongoDB database and use a tool like MongoDB Compass or directly through your backend code to insert the data.

Given that you are still in the development phase and might want to quickly iterate on the frontend without setting up a full backend, I would recommend starting with Local JSON Files. Here's how you can do it:

Create a new folder in your src directory called data.
Inside the data folder, create JSON files for your events, fights, and fighters. For example:
events.json
fights.json
fighters.json
Populate these JSON files with your data structure. Here's an example for events.json:
json
Copy code
[
{
"id": "event1",
"name": "Championship Fight Night",
"fights": ["fight1", "fight2"]
}
]
In your React components, you can import this data and use it as initial state. For example, in EventComponent.jsx:
javascript
Copy code
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import eventData from '../data/events.json';

const EventComponent = () => {
const [events, setEvents] = useState(eventData);

// ...rest of your component
}
When you move to production, you can replace the local JSON imports with API calls to your backend.
This approach allows you to quickly work with static data while maintaining the flexibility to switch to dynamic data from a backend without changing the structure of your components.

Now that we have a strategy for your data, we can proceed with building out the frontend components that use this data. Let me know if you want to start with a specific component or if you need further clarification on the data handling!

As an AI, I don't have the ability to remember past interactions between sessions. Each conversation with me is stateless, meaning that I don't retain any information from one interaction to the next. If you return for another session later, you'll need to remind me of our previous conversation or re-upload any files you'd like to continue working with.

However, for the duration of our current session, I can maintain the context and continue the workflow without any issues. If you're planning to resume work later, I recommend keeping notes or saving the conversation so you can quickly bring me up to speed next time.

Remember that your files and data are safe, as I cannot access them once our session ends.

i worked on front end.

i created my frontend app using vite.

I created 3 components: events, fight, and fighter.

I created 2 pages: landing and results.

i created a data folder and three json files: event, fighters, and fights

today i want to create the landing page.

i want to continue building out the frontend today.

help me create the landing page today.

i want to be able to present the events, fights, and fighters. i want to be able to click on the fighter that i think is going to win.

i want to include a button that will take the selections and generate the Results page. The Results page is going to show the user's picks in two ways: use the same components as we did in the landing page, and indicate which fighter the user selected; and in all text. this Results page has to be shareable.

help me create this today.

1/14/2023

This is what we have created so far:

1.  set up App.jsx with two routes:

    1. '/', that loads LandingPage
    2. '/results', that loads ResultsPage

2.  Created LandingPage

    1.  imports data files called eventData, fightsData, fightersData
    2.  sets events, fights, and fighters with their counterpart setter function
    3.  custom function called handleSelection. does what it says.
    4.  handleSubmit that logs the user selection and navigates to ResultsPage.
        const handleSubmit = () => {
        // Here, you would typically send the selections to the backend.
        // For simulation purposes, we'll just log the selections to the console
        console.log('User selections:', selections);

            // After submitting, we'll navigate to the Results Page
            // You'll need to setup and use the navigate function from React Router
            navigate('/results', { state: { selections, events, fighters } });

        };

    5.  eventComponent, fightComponent, and fighterComponent

Make me the Results Page with detailed step by step instructions. Thank vou very much in advance. Also, pls give me instructions in notes since I am still learning. Pls be my teacher. Thank you.

Also, keep in mind that users have to be able to see what they selected before they finally hit the generate button. I think we have to fix that with css so let's work on that later. Pls confirm you understand this is something we have to return to. Thanks.

ResultsPage

1. the selections state
