//  front end copilot notes

// Based on your requirements, you can use React.js to create the frontend of your application. Here's a simplified version of how you can structure your components:

// Header Component: This component will contain the title (h1) and a paragraph (p).
// FightEvent Component: This component will display the event information.
// Fighter Component: This component will display the fighter's information.
// FightInformation Component: This component will display the fight information.
// FightRow Component: This component will use the Fighter and FightInformation components.
// GenerateAndShare Component: This component will contain a button to generate and share the results.
// ResultsPage Component: This component will display the results.
// }
// LandingPage Component: This component will display the landing page.

// Please note that this is a simplified version and you'll need to add your own styles and functionality. Also, you'll need to pass the actual data to these components.
